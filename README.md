# Web3Insights

> A comprehensive metrics platform focused on Web3 ecosystems, communities, repositories, and developers

## Project Overview

While Web3 ecosystems share similarities with traditional open-source communities, standard metric systems often fall short in providing a holistic understanding, trend tracking, and project evaluation specific to Web3 initiatives. Web3Insights aims to bridge this gap by offering tailored analytics and insights for the unique landscape of Web3 projects.

For instance, communities like OpenBuild face challenges in efficiently evaluating active contributors and participants in projects such as their Bootcamp. Manual statistical management is time-consuming, and even with tools like OSS Insight, obtaining detailed performance metrics for individual developers remains difficult. Additionally, there's a lack of standardization in reward distribution within these ecosystems.

## Core Features

1. **Ecosystem Analytics**: Search and analyze active projects and contributors within specific Web3 ecosystems or communities, presenting comprehensive metric data.

2. **Project-Specific Insights**: Enable direct search of metrics data by project name, coupled with AI-powered analysis reports generated using GPT-4.

3. **Developer Profiling**: Search and compile open-source contribution data and on-chain ecosystem participation metrics using GitHub handles or Web3 wallet addresses.

4. **Customized Metric System**: Combine proprietary metric frameworks with a Web3 ecosystem database to offer tailored analysis dimensions for different ecosystems.

5. **Identity Correlation**: Continuously build a reliable database correlating GitHub users, email addresses, and wallet addresses within the Web3 space.

6. **Reward Distribution Platform**: (Currently in development)
   - Direct reward distribution to contributors who are platform users
   - Smart contract-generated Bounties/Grants for non-platform users, allowing them to claim rewards
   - User database matching and email notifications with authentication via GitHub handles

## Technology Stack & Architecture

Web3Insights utilizes Remix.js as its frontend framework, interacting with a dedicated Strapi backend for API services, data management, and user authentication.

1. **Frontend (Remix):** A React-based user interface built with Remix and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and NextUI components. Handles user interactions, client-side routing, and displays data fetched from the Strapi backend. Remix's server functions primarily handle Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and routing logic.
2. **Backend API & Authentication (Strapi):** A Node.js Strapi application serves as the core backend, providing RESTful APIs for data operations and handling user authentication (local auth and GitHub OAuth).
3. **Database:** PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database, managed by Strapi. Redis is used for caching to improve performance.
4. **AI Service:** Leverages OpenAI and Azure OpenAI API providers for generating insights and analysis reports.
5. **External Data Sources:** Fetches data from APIs like OpenDigger, OSS Insight, and RSS3 to gather metrics on repositories, developers, and ecosystems.

**Data Flow:**

User interactions trigger requests within the Remix frontend. Remix handles routing and SSR, making API calls to the Strapi backend for data fetching, mutations, and authentication. Strapi processes these requests, interacts with the database (PostgreSQL), cache (Redis), AI services, or external APIs as needed, and returns data to the Remix frontend for rendering.
